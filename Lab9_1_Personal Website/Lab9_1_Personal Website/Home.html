    <h4 style="color:brown;font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif Times, serif"> Developing:</h4>
    <p> My developing background has been limited to going to school. I attended The Computer Learning Center, in San Francisco
  , back in 1993-1994 mainly focusing on C language in a Unix environment, as well as Cobol and CICS in a Mainframe environment,
    and Novell. Most recently I attended the University of Phoenix Online where I studied Java, C++, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, XML, as well as database design using MS Access
    and Business SQL. Visual Studio was used extensively as an IDE along with a basic text editor.
    I finally am fortunate enough to be employed with a company that looks to build on their employees' capabilites and so 10
    years after graduating with a computer science degree in Software Engineering I am finally getting to brush the heavy rust
    off and get to work doing some actual coding - getting that work experience that I lacked upon graduation in 2010.</p>

    <h4 style="color:forestgreen;font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif Times, serif"> Hometown:</h4>
    <p> I grew up in the Green Mountain state of Vermont, in the small southeastern most town of Vernon. It was a town primarily
    made up of dairy farms and some small businesses. If you were to look it up we were best known as the home of Vermont Yankee -
    a nuclear power plant that has now been decommissioned. It was a great small town to grow up in with a population less than
    2000 residents. I attended Vernon Elementary School from 1st - 6th grade. I grew up helping with gathering hay bails in the
    summer, before moving on to working at the local recreation park doing cleaning, building and pool maintenance
    and upkeep.
    I moved from Vernon when I was 20 years old, after graduating from Vermont Technical College with a degree in Electrical/Electronics
    Engineering Technology and then joining the United States Army, as a Satellite Communications Operator/Maintainer,
    in 1986. I served 7 years and was stationed in High Wycombe, England for 4 years and finished at the Sacramento Army Depot,
    in 1993.</p>
