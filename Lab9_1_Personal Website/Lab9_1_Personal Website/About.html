    <h3 style="color:darkgreen;font-family:'Brush Script MT'"> My Bio Information:</h3>
   <p>  I am currently attending the Devbuild bootcamp, to transition into a Software Engineering role, within one of the
    companies under the FOC. I previously had been involved in desktop support over the past 19 years starting with EDS (Electronic Data Systems),
    which was bought by Hewlett Packard (HP) in 2008. In 2013 I was hired in by Genral Motors and worked until February 2019.
    In September 2019 I accepted a contract position with the Ohio Attorney's General Office, to conduct a Windows 10 migration
    of their Cleveland, Ohio and Youngstown, Ohio offices. I eventually accepted a position with Quicken Loans, in February 2020
    and worked as desktop support, before finally moving on to the DevBuild program in July of 2021.</p>
